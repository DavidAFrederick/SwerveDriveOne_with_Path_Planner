Notes on Code checkout and troubleshooting

Test Plan:
1) Test all of the minor movement functions first (Set them up in the robotcontainer file)

Suggestions:
1) Use the DriverStation Log Display tool to view robot logs
2) Add ">>>" to all diagnostic print statements to allow the Log Display tool to filter Events


Problems to Solve:
1) RobotPeriodic() taking too long (39mSec) causing WatchDog warnings
   Tried turning off Telemetry in RobotContainer Line 61
2) Robot driving to specific spot has errors - Forward/reverse is backwards
3) Robot driving to specific spot has errors - Lateral goes all over the place


Enhancements:
1) When the robot is powered down, the wheels go into the X-position.  Makes difficult to move.
   Update to not place the robot into the X-Position
2) Consider having the robot default to Robot-Oriented driving vs Field Oriented driving
3) Determine how to get rid of the "Un-Licenced function" warnings on Motors



Items to check:
1) Review all PID control systems to make sure the tolerance is using the 
   same units as the calculate function (Degrees vs Radians)
2) Do we need to use the Robot Pose?

Items to Document:
1) Need to document how to set the robot field position (Initial Robot Pose)
2) Document how to use the drive to position using the Data Class
3) Document how to enable no-vision test mode
4) Document how to configure drive to spot

   
Hardware Updates:
1) Add a switch to the robot to enable vision (Netgear switch ordered (5 volt))


What is working / almost working:
1) Path Planner with SmartDashboard picklist is working
2) Change heading is working.  Could use tuning.
3) Robot-Centric Driving is working (Reduced speed is in place at this time)
